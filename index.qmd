**My name is Phoo**, an aspiring Business Analyst with a strong interest in transforming data into actionable insights and meaningful stories.

This is my **Geospatial Data Science and Analytics** showcase, where I document and share my coursework and projects from this module.

In this space, I explore how geospatial analytics can answer real-world questions‚Äîsuch as where to locate new business outlets, what factors influence HDB resale prices, and how economic or service activities cluster or disperse across Singapore. **By applying methods like spatial data wrangling, geoprocessing, geospatial statistics, and machine learning, I uncover patterns and processes that support better decision-making.**

Take a look around and join me on this journey through data and geography! üåçüòä‚ú®
